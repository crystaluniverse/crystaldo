# crystaldo

TODO: Write a description here



## to get started

a oneliner gets you going (will remove existing installed version & rebuild)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystaluniverse/crystaldo/master/install.sh)" a pull reset
#next will only execute if not installed yet
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystaluniverse/crystaldo/master/install.sh)"
```
